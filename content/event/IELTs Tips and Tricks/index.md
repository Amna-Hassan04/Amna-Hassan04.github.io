## Key Takeaways

📌 **Test Structure**
- Listening: 30 min
- Reading: 60 min
- Writing: 60 min
- Speaking: 11–14 min
- Overall Band = average of all four modules

📚 **Learning Strategies**
- Don’t just practice—**practice the right way**.
- Study **band marking criteria** before any module.
- I only took **4 mock tests**—enough when done strategically.

🎧 **Listening (Band 9)**
- Watch TV series (*Friends, Wednesday, Lockwood & Co*) to train your ear.
- For MCQs: eliminate wrong answers instead of hunting for the right one.
- On maps: follow the speaker’s path with your finger/pencil.

📖 **Reading (Band 8)**
- Understand question types before testing yourself.
- Time yourself and aim to finish early.

✍️ **Writing (Band 7)**
- Learn structures for different essay types.
- Focus on clarity and organization, not just fancy vocabulary.

🗣 **Speaking (Band 8)**
- Start practicing with ChatGPT, then switch to human partners.
- Treat the examiner like a professional acquaintance.
- Smile—it makes you more confident and approachable.
- Fluency, vocabulary, and cohesion weigh more than perfect grammar.

💡 Smart prep beats repetitive testing—develop skills for each question type and then refine with quality practice.

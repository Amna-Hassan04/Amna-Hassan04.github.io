abstract: |
  On September 25th, 2025, I had the opportunity to deliver a **hands-on workshop** on *Introduction to Deep Learning*, organized by iCodeGuru in Urdu Language of Pakistan.  
  The session introduced participants to the **core concepts of neural networks** such as perceptrons, activation functions, forward & backpropagation, loss functions, and optimizers.  
  To keep it practical, we built a **digit recognition model** using the MNIST dataset with **Keras + TensorFlow**, giving participants real coding experience.

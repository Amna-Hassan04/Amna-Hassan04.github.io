      title: 'My Research Journey'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        My research journey began with a strong curiosity to explore beyond the classroom. In my 5th semester, I was awarded a research mentorship scholarship with an Assistant Professor at UC Irvine, where I was introduced to the essentials of academic writing, research design, and dataset creation.

        By the end of this mentorship, I authored my first paper:
        
        Automated Unity Game Template Generation from GDDs via NLP and Multi-Modal LLMs â€“ a framework that transforms game design documents into functional Unity templates. This work was featured on my mentors [website](https://researchcollegeprep.com/)
        and in his [newsletter/blog](https://researchcollegeprep.com/%f0%9f%9a%80-student-spotlight-advancing-ai-in-game-development/).
        
        Since then, Iâ€™ve been deeply enthusiastic about researchâ€”whether itâ€™s in AI, systems, or securityâ€”and Iâ€™m always eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute to new ideas.

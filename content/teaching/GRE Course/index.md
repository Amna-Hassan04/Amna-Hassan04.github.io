Over the course of **8 weeks**, I designed and delivered a comprehensive program to help students prepare for the **GRE (Graduate Record Examination)**.

The course covered all three sections—**Quantitative Reasoning, Verbal Reasoning, and Analytical Writing**—with a balance of **concept building, strategy, and timed practice**.

Each week combined **lectures, drills, and mock questions**, along with **weekly practice tests** to track progress and strengthen test-taking stamina.

This structured approach enabled students to build strong fundamentals, adopt effective strategies, and boost their **confidence on test day**.

For **two years**, I served as a **Section Leader** with **Stanford’s Code in Place**, where I guided a cohort of **10–15 students** through the first half of the renowned **CS106A Python curriculum**. Each week, I facilitated live small-group sessions focused on **control flow, loops, conditionals, console programs, graphics, lists, and dictionaries**, helping students build computational thinking through hands-on, creative assignments :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

This role emphasized **human-centered learning** at scale—paired with weekly interactive discussions, community support, and Stanford’s high-quality lecture videos, I helped learners globally engage with programming fundamentals more deeply :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

## Course Highlights
- 🐍 Taught core Python concepts: variables, conditionals, loops, console I/O, list/dictionary data structures.
- 🎨 Guided students through creative mini-projects in graphics and console programs.
- 💬 Held **live weekly sections**—personalized spaces where students could ask questions and collaborate.
- 🌍 Contributed to a global, inclusive learning community with a 1:10 **leader-to-student ratio** :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

By the end of the course, students progressed from zero coding experience to confidently writing Python programs, thinking algorithmically, and solving problems creatively—all within a supportive, interactive setting.

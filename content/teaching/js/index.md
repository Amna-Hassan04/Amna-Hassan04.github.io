Over the course of **10 weeks**, I designed and delivered a structured program on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.

The course began with the **fundamentals**—arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and hash maps—and gradually progressed through **trees, graphs, recursion, and backtracking**, culminating in **dynamic programming**.

Each week combined **theory + coding practice**, with students solving curated **LeetCode problems** to reinforce concepts and develop problem-solving skills.

This hands-on approach not only helped students grasp core DSA topics but also prepared them for **coding interviews and competitive programming challenges**.

## Course Highlights
- 📘 Covered **basic to advanced DSA concepts** step by step.
- 💻 Integrated **LeetCode problem-solving** for practical application.
- 🎯 Designed with a focus on **interview preparation and logical thinking**.
- ⏱ Delivered in a **10-week structured timeline** with consistent progression.

By the end of the course, participants gained a **solid foundation in DSA**, improved their **coding efficiency**, and felt more confident in **tackling complex problems**.

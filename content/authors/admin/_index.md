## About Me

I am a final-year Computer Science student at the University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila (GPA 3.6/4.0). My research interests span Artificial Intelligence, Systems, and Security, with applications in Healthcare, Accessibility, and Networking.

I bring a balance of applied research, systems-level project development, and community leadership. My experiences include research at UC Irvine on AI in game development, deep learning for medical imaging, large-scale open-source software leadership, and practical projects in systems, compilers, and security-driven design.

I am preparing to pursue a fully funded PhD in Fall 2026 and am open to working across AI, systems, networking, and security domains, with the goal of advancing technologies that are both innovative and impactful.

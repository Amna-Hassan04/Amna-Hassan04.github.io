## About Me

I am a final-year Computer Science student at the University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila (GPA 3.6/4.0), with an IELTS band score of 8 and recently selected as a Google Generation Scholar for 2025–26.

I have participated in 30+ international hackathons—winning awards at venues like Google, Anthropic, and Harvard—demonstrating my ability to adapt quickly, collaborate with diverse teams, and deliver innovative solutions under tight deadlines. My work spans multiple domains, from AI and accessibility-focused projects to systems, compilers, and security-driven design. Leading open-source projects has further strengthened my technical expertise and collaborative skills.

Looking ahead, I am preparing to pursue a fully funded PhD starting Fall 2026, eager to contribute to projects across AI, systems, networking, and security while building technologies that are both cutting-edge and socially impactful.

## 🌍 Overview

I’m beyond thrilled to share one of the biggest milestones of my career!  
This year, my project **SereniFi** was selected as part of the **GirlScript Summer of Code Extended (GSSoC Extd) 2024** — a program that brought together over **42,000 contributors** in open-source development. Out of this massive pool, I was honored to be one of the **200 selected Project Administrators**, a role I embraced with pride and responsibility.

As the Project Administrator, I had the chance to mentor contributors, guide development, and build a thriving open-source community around SereniFi — an app designed to bring **mental peace** through guided meditations, breathing exercises, and relaxing music.

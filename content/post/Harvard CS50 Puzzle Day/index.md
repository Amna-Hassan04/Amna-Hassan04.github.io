## 🏆 My Winning Streak

- **Year 1:** Took on the challenge, built an incredible team, and cracked some of the toughest puzzles I had ever seen.
- **Year 2:** Came back stronger and secured another win — proving consistency matters as much as raw problem-solving ability.

What makes this event so exciting is the **global participation** — you’re competing alongside thousands of brilliant minds from across the world, all trying to out-think each other one puzzle at a time.

Sorting algorithms are fundamental to computer science, with uses in databases, simulations, and beyond. However, grasping the nuances of sorts like merge, heap, and quick can perplex beginners. My project aims to help students comprehend these algorithms better through examples and clear explanations of each technique. By experimenting with example arrays and observing step-by-step walkthroughs, students can recognize how common approaches like selection sort, bubble sort and insertion sort reorder lists from minimum to maximum. With engaging practices and straightforward descriptions, my work intends to unravel sorting algorithms for students, allowing them to understand how techniques including bubble, selection and insertion handle arranging sets of numbers or other data.

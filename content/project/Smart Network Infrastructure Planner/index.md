The Smart Network Infrastructure Planner builds on the findings of the PASQAL Hackathon on Quantum Computing, which revealed the significant risks that climate change poses to telecommunications infrastructure, with disruptions expected to escalate in underserved regions by 2047. Using these insights, the planner integrates AI, quantum computing, and dynamic datasets to optimize telecommunications deployment, focusing on climate resilience and improving connectivity in vulnerable communities. Key innovations envisioned for the planner include: Dynamic AI-Driven Analysis: Predicts vulnerabilities and recommends climate-resilient strategies, enhancing operational efficiency, reducing downtime, and minimizing risk. Integration of Hugging Face Datasets: Provides real-time, adaptive planning by leveraging environmental and demographic data to identify and prioritize high-need areas. Interactive Streamlit Application: Empowers stakeholders to simulate deployment scenarios, visualize complex data, and collaborate effectively, fostering alignment and better decision-making. Budget Optimization: Prioritizes resource allocation for underserved regions, ensuring cost efficiency and maximizing ROI while addressing connectivity gaps. Sustainability Metrics: Embeds long-term resilience and environmental standards into planning to support sustainable development goals and enhance corporate social responsibility. These features deliver measurable business outcomes, including enhanced network reliability, optimized resource utilization, cost savings, and improved service in underserved regions. By addressing both current and future challenges, the planner empowers organizations to bridge the digital divide, mitigate climate risks, and unlock new opportunities in emerging markets. It transforms research findings from the PASQAL Hackathon into actionable strategies that support sustainable and equitable connectivity while creating competitive advantages in uncertain environments.

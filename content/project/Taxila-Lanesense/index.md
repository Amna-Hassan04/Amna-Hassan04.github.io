**Taxila LaneSense** is a lightweight computer vision tool that detects lane lines, measures vehicle offset from the lane center, and visualizes lane width trends through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.  
Built using OpenCV, it helps analyze driving behavior at accident-prone locations such as the Taxila Underpass by providing quick and meaningful visual insights.

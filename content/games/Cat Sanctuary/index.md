## Overview

**Cat Sanctuary** is a psychological survival horror game that combines atmospheric storytelling with puzzle-solving mechanics. Players take on the role of a caretaker who discovers the dark secrets lurking within an abandoned cat sanctuary.

## Story

After years of suffocating under the weight of an unremarkable life in a mundane town, you found yourself desperate to escape. The job posting seemed like fate—*"Caretaker Wanted: Cozy Cat Sanctuary Needs a Helping Hand."*

But as the sun dips below the horizon, a cold unease settles over the sanctuary. Shadows move on their own, faint whispers echo through the hallways, and the cats watch something you can't see.

The sanctuary carries a sinister secret—a curse born from the cruelty of its former caretaker. A demon now haunts the grounds, and only you can break the curse by unearthing the fragmented remains of the caretaker and burying them in consecrated ground.

summary: |
  Bone fractures present a major global health challenge, particularly in low-resource settings with limited access to expert radiology. 
  We developed an AI-based solution for automated fracture detection from X-ray images using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and benchmarked it against transfer learning models including EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50. 
  Training was conducted on the FracAtlas dataset, comprising 4,083 anonymized musculoskeletal radiographs. 
  The custom CNN achieved 95.96% accuracy, 0.94 precision, 0.88 recall, and an F1-score of 0.91. 
  Transfer learning models performed poorly in this specific setup, highlighting the importance of dataset considerations and external validation. 
  This work underscores the potential of lightweight CNNs for fracture detection in X-rays and the need for fair benchmarking for clinical translation.
